# To-Do Single Page Application

The final student exercise on my bootcamp course was a single-page to-do app, featuring a fluid UI that - by using JavaScript - allowed users to rapidly add dynamic content.

This became the basis of my student-mentor project, adding individual user authentication, multiple to-do lists & the ability for list items to be re-ordered.

A demo of the site can be seen here: http://todo-john-henderson.herokuapp.com/
